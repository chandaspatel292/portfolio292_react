the portfolio website is to have a split screen, the left side showing the different categories that the website has to offer
and the right side to show the detailed explanation of these categories,
the categories are slightly in the background with one category showing up in the middle, and simillarly one detailed explanation
about the category shows up in the right side of the screen with other explanation slightly in the background
the categories and the explanations are brought to focus by pressing the up or down key or scrolling on the respective side of the screen
the categories and the explanation scroll in opposite ways, as the categories are scrolled up, its respective explanation scrolls down and vica versa
the scroll action will have a cylindrical look to it.
